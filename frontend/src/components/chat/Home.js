          <p>
            Spartacus is a modular cognitive system used by the AD Cloud to
            extract deep insights, often in real-time, from asset, operational
            and external data sources. It is a key part of AD Cloudâ€™s autonomous
            UAV initiative. A natural language processing (NLP) digital agent
            with deep neural learning abilities and a modular architecture,
            Spartacus can learn specialized skills, developed on a case by case
            basis.
